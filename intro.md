# Design and Evaluation of a Benchmark for Solana Code Generation

## Abstract

This paper proposes a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating TypeScript code commonly used on the Solana blockchain. The benchmark assesses the functionality and quality of code generation across multiple real-world scenarios, including token transactions, liquidity provision, and contract interactions. Through a series of functional tests, boundary tests, and security checks, we measure the correctness and feasibility of model-generated code. Using automated CI testing pipelines and quantitative metrics (such as test pass rates, error type classification, development iteration counts), we compare the performance of different models/systems in a unified evaluation environment. Results show that this benchmark effectively differentiates code generation systems' capabilities in Solana development scenarios, providing valuable reference for future model and tool improvements.

## Introduction

With the rapid development of blockchain technology, the Solana ecosystem has attracted numerous decentralized applications (dApps) and developers due to its high throughput and low cost advantages. Correspondingly, the demand for generating smart contracts and on-chain interaction code has grown. Large Language Models (such as GPT series, LLaMA) have shown initial potential in general code generation and automated script writing, but there are still many challenges in Solana-specific development, such as:

- Familiarity with Solana-specific concepts like account model, transaction instructions, and SPL Token standards.
- Handling interactions with different DeFi protocols and contracts (like Serum, Raydium, Meteora).
- Balancing security, fees, exception handling, and human values/compliance guidelines.

Therefore, to quantitatively evaluate LLMs' capabilities and limitations in Solana code generation scenarios, we designed and implemented a **Benchmark for Solana Code Generation**. This benchmark addresses real-world requirements, covers various common functional modules and complex interaction scenarios, and provides unified testing standards and evaluation metrics to objectively measure the performance of different models or systems.

## Related Work

With the progress of large language models in program code generation, many benchmarks for general programming languages (such as Python, JavaScript) have emerged, like HumanEval and MBPP (Multi-lingual Programming Benchmark). However, these benchmarks mainly focus on general programming tasks and haven't delved into the blockchain domain, particularly lacking systematic testing of Solana chain characteristics (transaction account structure, SPL Token operations, runtime environment, speed and fees, etc.).

Some work has attempted to experiment with smart contract generation for EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains, but the Solana ecosystem has significant differences in underlying mechanisms (such as on-chain programs written in Rust or C/C++, Anchor toolchain, concurrency model, rent model, etc.). Therefore, a dedicated benchmark for Solana remains a gap. We hope to fill this gap through this research, providing a reproducible and quantifiable framework for further in-depth studies.

## Benchmark Design

### Design Principles

1. **Real Scenarios**: Select the most common or fundamental functionalities in Solana development, such as creating and signing transactions, interacting with token contracts, DeFi protocol liquidity operations.
2. **Multi-dimensional Difficulty**: Cover basic and advanced use cases from simple single-step transactions to complex multi-contract interactions, testing models' ability to handle different levels of complexity.
3. **Evaluability**: Each task has complete input/output specifications, clear function signatures or interface descriptions, and unit tests or integration tests.
4. **Unified Environment**: Use TypeScript as the primary development language, specify particular versions of Solana Web3.js or Anchor framework, and maintain a unified Node.js/TS compilation testing environment.

### Task Scenarios

We have defined several task examples in the benchmark, including but not limited to:

1. **Token Transaction Functions**
    - For example, writing a `buyToken(payerPubKey, tokenMint, amount)` function that constructs and returns an unsigned purchase transaction using Solana's Web3.js library.
    - Need to handle input validation, transaction fee estimation, exception catching, etc.
2. **Adding Liquidity**
    - For liquidity pools like Meteora DLMM, write `calcLiquidityBound(solPrice, params)` to calculate USD price bounds; or based on Raydium, create a transaction function to add specified token amounts to a designated pool.
    - Examine correct usage of essential DeFi protocol parameters (like slippage, token pairs, pool IDs).
3. **Composite Tasks**
    - For example, writing batch transactions that combine multiple instructions (like token approval, transfer, or liquidity addition) into one transaction to reduce user signature counts or fees.
    - May require additional logic handling for mechanisms like multi-signature or RentExemption.
4. **Security and Compliance**
    - Deliberately introduce malicious parameters or extreme boundary values (like negative amounts, invalid public keys, excessive slippage) to test security checks and error handling in generated code.

### Input, Output, and Testing

- **Input**: Task description (including function signatures, external dependencies, necessary contract or API documentation), and public test cases.
- **Output**: TypeScript source code files (or snippets) that meet task requirements and can be directly compiled and run.
- **Test Cases**: Written in Jest or Mocha+Chai, including:
  - Functional tests: Verify core logic (like correct transaction construction and return, calculation accuracy).
  - Boundary tests: Extreme values, invalid inputs, exception handling.
  - (Optional) Hidden tests: Prevent models from "hardcoding" known tests, ensuring evaluation of generalization ability.

### Test Case Design Examples

To clarify how this benchmark operates, we have defined several typical and practically valuable test cases for Solana chain development scenarios. Here are the detailed explanations:

#### Test Case 1: Build a Transaction Function for Buying Tokens on pump.fun

- **Function Signature**:
```typescript
  /**
   * Creates an instruction to buy tokens from a pumpfun token
   * 
   * @param buyer - The account that will buy the tokens
   * @param mint - The mint address of the token to buy
   * @param tokenAmount - The amount of tokens to buy (in token units)
   * @param maxSolCost - The maximum amount of SOL to spend (in lamports)
   * @returns TransactionInstruction
   */
  export async function createBuyInstruction(
    buyer: PublicKey,
    mint: PublicKey,
    tokenAmount: bigint,
    maxSolCost: bigint
  ): Promise<TransactionInstruction>
```

- **Test Objectives**:
  - Can correctly construct Solana chain transactions for token purchases.
  - Can correctly generate unsigned transaction objects (Transaction).
  - Transaction fee estimation is reasonable.

- **Test Coverage Points**:
  1. Regular purchase behavior (normal input).
  2. Boundary cases (must properly handle and throw exceptions when amount=0 or negative).
  3. Exception cases (invalid payerPublicKey or tokenMint, must throw appropriate exceptions).

#### Test Case 2: Build a Transaction Function for Buying Tokens on Raydium V4 AMM

- **Function Signature**:
```typescript
async function buyTokenRaydiumV4(
  payerPublicKey: string, 
  poolAddress: string, 
  tokenInMint: string,
  tokenOutMint: string,
  amountIn: number,
  slippage: number
): Promise<Transaction>
```

- **Test Objectives**:
  - Can the function construct correct Raydium V4 AMM token swap transactions.
  - Whether slippage parameter is considered.
  - Correct handling of Solana transaction account permissions and required Raydium-specific accounts.

- **Test Coverage Points**:
  1. Normal transaction flow (valid parameters).
  2. Behavior with extreme slippage settings (like 0%, 100%).
  3. Handling of invalid pool addresses or token mint addresses (proper exception throwing).

#### Test Case 3: Build Raydium AMM Transaction by Querying On-chain Data via RPC (Without Using Raydium API)

- **Function Signature**:
```typescript
async function fetchRaydiumPoolDataFromRpc(
  rpcEndpoint: string,
  poolAddress: string
): Promise<RaydiumPoolData>
```

- **Test Objectives**:
  - Fetch required pool data through Solana's native RPC interface rather than Raydium API.
  - Verify completeness and correctness of returned data (token reserve, lp fee, authority address, etc.).

- **Test Coverage Points**:
  1. Validation of normal pool data accuracy (comparison with API data, allowing minor discrepancies).
  2. Handling of RPC call failures or timeouts.
  3. Invalid pool address handling (clear readable exceptions).

#### Test Case 4: Calculate USD Price Boundaries for Meteora DLMM Liquidity Addition (Assuming SOL Price is $150)

- **Function Signature**:
```typescript
interface AddLiquidityParams {
  tokenAmountA: number;
  tokenAmountB: number;
  tokenPriceA: number;
  tokenPriceB: number;
  slippage: number;
}

function calcLiquidityUsdBound(
  solPrice: number, 
  params: AddLiquidityParams
): { lowerBoundUsd: number; upperBoundUsd: number }
```

- **Test Objectives**:
  - Correctly calculate USD-denominated price boundaries based on input parameters and fixed Solana price ($150).
  - Proper handling of transaction slippage and liquidity calculation formula.

- **Test Coverage Points**:
  1. Normal liquidity price calculation, verify price boundary accuracy.
  2. Boundary value testing (slippage 0%, 100%, or extreme token amounts).
  3. Unreasonable parameter testing (negative or zero quantities, abnormally high/low prices).

#### Test Case 5: Fetch and Record All Raydium V4 AMM Pool Creation Transactions via Yellowstone GRPC

- **Function Signature**:
```typescript
async function fetchRaydiumPoolsViaGrpc(
  grpcEndpoint: string
): Promise<string[]>
```

- **Test Objectives**:
  - Can track on-chain events via Yellowstone GRPC interface and correctly capture Raydium V4 AMM Pool creation transactions.
  - Accurately extract and return all newly created AMM Pool addresses.

- **Test Coverage Points**:
  1. Transaction capture accuracy under normal network connection (compared with official historical records).
  2. Robustness and exception handling during network interruption or GRPC service unavailability.
  3. Performance in high-frequency trading scenarios (whether transactions are missed or duplicated).

## Testing Process and Automation

All above test cases are implemented using standard automated testing frameworks (like Jest or Mocha):

- Automatically execute tests in a unified CI/CD Pipeline environment (like GitHub Actions).
- Automatically trigger tests and generate detailed reports after each code generation, including:
  - Test case coverage;
  - Pass/fail statistics;
  - Exception cause analysis and code correction suggestions.

---

The implementation and evaluation process of the above test cases can effectively examine the actual performance of models or systems in Solana chain code generation scenarios. Through quantitative evaluation of specific cases, we provide solid data support and empirical basis for further optimizing code generation tools and improving model support for real blockchain development scenarios.

## Evaluation Methods

### System Architecture and Process

1. **Code Generation Phase**:
    - Input uniformly formatted task descriptions and public test cases to the target large language model or system (like direct GPT-4 calls or using MAGI System's multi-round iteration mechanism).
    - Record one or multiple generated versions, and annotate each version with corresponding prompt context and configuration parameters (like temperature, max_tokens).
2. **Automated Testing Phase**:
    - Place generated TypeScript code with pre-written test scripts in the same project, execute `npm run test` or `yarn test`.
    - Collect test results: pass/fail/exception causes, and generate detailed reports.
3. **Data Collection and Metric Calculation**:
    - Collect information on code quality, compilability, runtime behavior, test pass rates, and error logs.
    - Compare overall performance and differences in subtasks among different models/systems.

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Test Pass Rate**:
    - Primary quantitative metric: number of passed test cases / total test cases.
    - Calculate pass rates separately for different difficulty levels, such as basic cases, extended cases, hidden cases.
2. **Error Types and Severity**:
    - Such as compilation errors (Syntax/Type Error), runtime exceptions, logic errors (unexpected return values), security errors (potential security risks due to unvalidated input).
    - Track frequency of each error type to analyze system weaknesses in specific dimensions.
3. **Code Quality (Optional Subjective Evaluation)**:
    - Manual review metrics like comment completeness, variable naming conventions, use of best practices (security checks when using TransactionInstruction, exception catching).
4. **Iteration Count and Development Efficiency (Optional)**:
    - For multi-round generation (like voting and feedback mechanism in MAGI System), record interaction rounds or time needed from initial version to passing all tests, measuring development efficiency and user experience.
5. **Deployment and Gas Fees (Optional)**:
    - If extended to actual running on testnet/Devnet, measure transaction success rates, resource consumption, and gas fees, closer to real production environment requirements.

## Experiments and Results

In this study, we focused on two example tasks (token purchase transaction function and liquidity boundary calculation function), supplemented with more DeFi interaction tasks to extend benchmark scenarios. After comparing code generated by various large language models (like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, MAGI System) under identical hardware and dependency environments, we drew the following preliminary conclusions:

1. **Test Pass Rate**:
    - When directly calling certain models, high pass rates were achieved for simple functions (like token purchase), but more failures occurred in advanced tasks involving slippage, fee calculation, and cross-contract queries.
    - Systems with multi-round iteration or voting correction mechanisms (like MAGI System) often quickly corrected after initial failures, achieving higher final pass rates.
2. **Error Types**:
    - Compilation errors mostly came from improper Solana Web3.js API calls or object structure mismatches.
    - Logic errors mainly stemmed from inaccurate DeFi protocol parameter calculations and lack of boundary handling.
3. **Security and Exception Handling**:
    - Some model outputs ignored handling of `amount <= 0` or invalid `PubKey`, leading to potential risks.
    - After multiple rounds of feedback, these errors could be explicitly identified and fixed.
4. **Human Readability Evaluation**:
    - Differences exist but gaps are smaller in core functionality implementation; some models (like GPT-4) did better in comments and explanations.

## Discussion and Future Work

This benchmark initially validates the need and feasibility of evaluating Solana-specific code generation, while also exposing common deficiencies of current large language models in blockchain-specific scenarios: insufficient grasp of contract call parameters, account permissions, rent, fees, and other special logic. Additionally, generated code security remains an ongoing concern.

Future improvements and extensions to this benchmark could include:

1. **Richer Scenarios**: Beyond ordinary transactions, add more complex functionalities like derivatives (options, futures) contracts and NFT-related operations.
2. **Contract-level Testing**: Focus on contract deployment and upgrade script auto-generation for Anchor or Rust programs, with actual running in Devnet environment.
3. **Security Audit and Specification Checking**: Write more in-depth Lint or SAST scripts for automatic scanning of potential security vulnerabilities.
4. **Multi-language and Cross-platform**: Further compare differences among TypeScript, Rust, Python in Solana development, and extend to other public chain ecosystems like EVM, Aptos, Sui.

## Conclusion

This paper presents a dedicated benchmark for Solana chain code generation, covering real application requirements and multi-level difficulty test scenarios. Through automated testing and detailed evaluation metrics, it quantitatively compares the performance of different large language models or systems. Experimental results show that this benchmark can effectively differentiate models' capabilities in the Solana-specific domain while helping identify common error types and potential security risks. In the future, we will continue to expand test coverage and security audit depth, providing a more comprehensive Solana code generation evaluation standard for the industry, and promoting safer and more efficient application of code generation technology in the blockchain ecosystem.
